# Exercise 2: writing and executing functions (II)

# Write a function `CompareLength` that takes in 2 vectors, and returns the sentence:
# "The difference in lengths is N"
CompareLength <- function(a, b) {
  paste("The difference in lengths is", abs(a - b))
}

# Pass two vectors of different length to your `CompareLength` function
CompareLength(2, 7)

# Write a function `DescribeDifference` that will return one of the following statements:
# "Your first vector is longer by N elements"
# "Your second vector is longer by N elements"
DescribeDifference <- function(v1, v2) {
  diff <- abs(length(v1) - length(v2))
  if (length(v1) > length(v2)) {
    paste("Your first vector is longer by ", diff, " elements")
  } else {
    paste("Your second vector is longer by ", diff, " elements")
  }
}

# Pass two vectors to your `DescribeDifference` function
DescribeDifference(c('cookies', 'candy', 'ice cream', 'cake'), c('carrot', 'broccoli'))
